# Caldera
A Tool for generating consensus upon provenance of an Artists artwork through Distributed Consensus

## About
Despite the best efforts and intentions, establishing the provenance of highly valuble artwork often fractures under the weight of a variety of competing interests. Expert certification is oft the difference between worthless and priceless, exposing the experts to the legal retaliation of a property insurances' claims department.  Given artworks diverse character and often long and dark history, incentives for buyers and sellers to decieve each other has led to highly centralized, monopolistic markets, as reputation offers the best signal for authenticity. At the centre of all quarrels over an artworks provenance rests the Catalogue Raisonne.

A Catalogue Raisonne is a comprehensive, annotated listing of an artists works with descriptions that allow third parties to establish authenticity.  Traditionally these works are the creation of an individual or small subset of stake holders whose interests align with each other. In the understanding that provenance is an act of consensus among staked parties, Caldera offers a solution to grow consensus on provenance among large subsets of stakeholders who are in competition with each other in a dynamic fashion.

This tool is named in honour of American sculptor Alexander Calder, whose mobiles frequently remind me of illustrations of distributed computer systems. Additionally, this tool was inspired by that of the Calder Foundation, whose revolutionary desicion to forgo authentication in favour of registration and examination is a process I wish to automate and share with the world.

## Setting Up

### Dev
As a distributed system This application is containerized and managed as a Kubernetes cluster. I recommend Minikube for development purposes.
